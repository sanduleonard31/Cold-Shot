    "master-1-then-desc": "I had the opportunity to work closely with a partner who, at the beginning, had no experience in the world of coffee but showed a sincere curiosity. I saw her potential and the desire to learn, so I decided to guide her step by step on this journey, starting with a simple latte art exercise - a swan.",
    "master-1-now-desc": "Mentoring her through the Coffee Master program was an extraordinary journey. She eventually competed in the national Barista Championship 2024, placing in the top 3. This achievement confirmed not just her talent, but the power of guidance and mutual trust. This experience showed me how important it is to invest in people, to give them space to grow, and to show them they can achieve great things when supported. I am proud to have helped uncover a passion that will surely continue to inspire and define her professionally."
