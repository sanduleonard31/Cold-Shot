    "description": "A coffee tasting that takes you from the heart of Latin America to the exotic Indonesian Archipelago. Guatemala Antigua surprises with vibrant notes of cocoa, fine spices, and balanced acidity, while Bali brings dense, earthy, and woody aromas, with exotic accents and a velvety body â€“ a journey through two coffee worlds, in a single tasting experience.\n- Rusu Andrei"
