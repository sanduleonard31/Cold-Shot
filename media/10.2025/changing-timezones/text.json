    "master-1-now-desc": "As a Coffee Master, I understood that I don't just make 'coffee'! I understand, feel, and communicate the story of the coffee bean, transforming the experience of drinking coffee into an art. Beyond the technique, I also discovered the human side: the smile of a customer when they receive a carefully made coffee and the simple conversations that start with: 'How do you like your coffee?' I haven't stopped learning and have a monthly practice plan to develop my skills."
