    "title": "The barista and his fight with steamed milk",
    "description": "In the first month, a barista looks at the milk pitcher like it's a blank canvas. They pour the milk with hope and get... a shape that vaguely resembles a UFO. By the second month, a heart starts to emerge. Well, something the team calls 'the potato.' By the third month, the barista is convinced the milk foam has a will of its own and is waging a personal battle against them. They start talking to it: 'Come on, please, today we're making a leaf, okay? Not a ghost with cramps!' But something changes in the fourth month. Suddenly, the hearts have symmetry, the leaves have veins, and one day... a dragon appears. Yes, a dragon in the coffee. The customer took a picture, posted it on Instagram, and the barista became 'The Barista with the Magic Foam.' From the fifth month on, the barista no longer just makes coffee; they create art. People don't come for the caffeine anymore, but for the latte art exhibition. And the foam? Well, now it listens. Or at least, that's what they think. So, if you believe latte art is only for 'artists with a degree in foamology,' think about our barista. They started with a crooked heart and ended up drawing dragons. All you need is a little patience, a lot of coffee, and the courage to laugh at your first attempts. Because every cup is a canvas, and you are the artist. Go on, pour with confidenceâ€”the world needs more coffee with soul! - Damaschin Emilian"
