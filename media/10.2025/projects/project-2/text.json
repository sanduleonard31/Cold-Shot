    "description": "A perspective on Burundi, the 'Heart of Africa', and its rapid emergence on the specialty coffee scene. From the first Arabica trees introduced by Belgian colonists in the 1920s, the country now focuses on quality over quantity. The unique Red Bourbon variety, grown in fertile volcanic soils at high altitudes, produces a complex coffee with a rich body and wild floral-fruity notes. - Andreea Ioana Ciuma"
