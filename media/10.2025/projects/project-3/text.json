    "description": "A perspective on Cameroon's coffee industry, from its dominant Robusta exports to the challenges faced by its farmers. The country cultivates two distinct coffees: the rich, nutty Robusta, which makes up the majority of production, and the sweet, fruity Arabica, featuring Typica and Bourbon varieties. However, the sector grapples with significant hurdles, including the legacy of sector liberalization and persistent issues in production and quality control.\n- Andreea Ioana Ciuma"
