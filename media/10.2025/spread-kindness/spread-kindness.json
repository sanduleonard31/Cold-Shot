With a warm smile, George suggested Verona – 'the coffee of love.' ❤️ To his astonishment, the woman revealed she was Italian. The couple had first met 25 years ago in Verona, the city where their love story began. What started as a simple recommendation turned into a moment of profound connection, proving that sometimes, a coffee can hold a lifetime of stories."
